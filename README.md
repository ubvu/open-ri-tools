# Open RI tools: discover the impact of your research

*Open RI (Research Intelligence) tools are web-applications for researchers that can help with questions regarding research metadata, such as "is my research cited in clinical trials?".*

Commercial applications offer these insights as well, but they are usually closed systems, contradicting the premise of open science.
We use open databases such as [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) to offer an alternative platform, involving researchers in the development process. Check out our [contribution guide](#contribute).

## Try it out yourself!

All tools are created with [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) and other tools within the [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org/) ecosystem.

There are two ways to run the tools in your browser:
- as static websites; this deployment uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/)
- as hosted web applications (limited availability)

Follow the links in the table below, not all applications are currently available:

| Tool | Website | Application |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Citations in clinical trials | [Yes](https://ubvu.github.io/open-ri-tools/clinical_trials.html) | [Yes](https://open-ri-tools-42fcc89e2d28.herokuapp.com/) |
| Collaboration with global south | [Yes](https://ubvu.github.io/open-ri-tools/global_south.html) | [Yes](https://open-ri-tools2-8ff4ed866ade.herokuapp.com/) |
| Coauthor network | [Yes](https://ubvu.github.io/open-ri-tools/coauthor_network.html) | No |

-->

For the static websites, we use Progressive Web Apps which allows you to install each application on your computer, e.g. follow the instructions for [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361).

## Ideas and suggestions?

Whether you are a researcher with ideas for (new) tools or a developer with improvement suggestions, please let us know by creating an [issue](https://github.com/ubvu/open-ri-tools/issues). 
If you would like to contribute by writing code yourself, awesome, follow this [guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
